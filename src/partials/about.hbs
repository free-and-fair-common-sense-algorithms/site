  <h3 class="mb-3">Free and Fair Commonsense Algorithms for Society’s mission is to develop and promote equitable, auditable, and accessible machine learning solutions that improve the quality of life for all people equally.</h3>
  <p>Artificial intelligence promises to usher in an era where big data enables automated solutions for society’s problems. The foundation for this future is built upon the development of decision making algorithms. Algorithms promise to scale decision making beyond the limitations of humans: they increase efficiency (because they don’t exhaust), they scale exponentially (they don’t require boundless people), and they are free of subjective human biases (they are based upon math, which is objective). Private companies and organizations develop these algorithmic decision making systems to replace the work of employees or officials (the “deciders”). When put to use, however, these algorithms rarely provide clear improvements over the status quo, and more often, cause harm to those on the receiving end of these algorithmic decisions (the “impacted”) than human decision makers. </p>
  <p>Algorithms like Equivant’s COMPAS or Arnold Ventures’ PSA, both pretrial risk assessment algorithms designed to predict the likelihood of a defendant to commit a crime in the future, attempt to make it easier for judges to determine who to incarcerate but they often recommend sending low-risk people into detention when they should be freed. This is just one example out of many.</p>
  <p>Automated decision-making does not have to be this way. When developed properly, algorithms can work in accordance with the interests of the people, the impacted. Free and Fair Commonsense Algorithms for Society (FAFCSAFS) was established to do just that: provide algorithmic decision making solutions that actually improve society. Imagine a world where the deciders aren’t burdened by making tough choices, and the impacted know that decisions are made with their best interest in mind; this is FAFCSAFS.</p>

  <p class="mt-3 mb-0"> Free and Fair Commonsense Algorithms for Society enshrines these core principles:</p>
  <p class="dashed mb-1"><span class="font-weight-bold">Free:</span> As with all public services, algorithms should be of no cost to the consumer.</p>
  <p class="dashed mb-1"><span class="font-weight-bold">Fair:</span> In order to ensure all are treated equally, algorithms should be completely void of any disparate impact.</p>
  <p class="dashed mb-0"><span class="font-weight-bold">Commonsense:</span> To build trust, algorithms should be understandable and aligned with the interests of the people.</p>

  <p class="mt-3">FAFCSAFS provides individuals and organizations easy access to high-quality algorithmic decision making systems for various situations where fairness is paramount and human biases can severely jeopardize any outcome. With FAFCSAFS, visitors submit information through web forms and instantly receive fair and unbiased recommendations from machine learning models based on the information submitted.</p>
